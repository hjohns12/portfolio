        <h2>Narrative Project: Who's Still Talking About Guantánamo Bay?</h2>
        <br/>
    <p>
        After listening to a podcast, "The Other Latif" (which I highly recommend!), I realized that I don't read much news about Guantánamo Bay these days.
        I wanted to dig into how much or how little the mainstream media has reported on the subject over the past decade.

    <h3>Design Process</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>
        The data generated by running a chain provided a lot of information, and my goal was to let the user explore how each 
        variable interacted with the others. Every row represented one possible redistricting plan, and I had information on the predicted vote share by district, 
        state-wide seat share, and the efficiency gap for each plan. I decided to create three main components that would all interact with each other: a box-and-whisker plot summarizing the 
        vote shares from the ensemble, a histogram displaying the spread of efficiency gaps, and a table to show the seat share for each data point. 
        Below is one of my first sketches showing how I initially envisioned the final product.

        The technical architecture helped me keep track of what needed to be re-drawn once a change was made by the user (i.e., new selection
        from the drop-down or click on a new dot). I followed this document very closely when I started coding in order to keep track of all of the moving parts!

    <h3>Technical Documentation</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>
    The data-generating process for this project was quite intensive. To create the final data I used <a href="https://gerrychain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">GerryChain</a>, a python library for using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods
     to study the problem of political redistricting. 

    The basic workflow is to start with the geometry of an initial plan (aka "initial partition") and generate a large collection of sample plans for comparison. 
    I constrained these sampled plans based on contiguity and population deviation between districts. Comparing the initial plan to the ensemble provides quantitative tools for measuring whether or not it is an outlier among the sampled plans.
    </p>

    <p>
    All of my data sources can be found in the README of <a href="https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/gerryspam/tree/master/MO">this repository</a>. 
    To clean the data, I used a precinct-level map from 2016 matched with elections. I labelled each precinct with state senate and state house legislative districts, 
    and aggregated the 2010 Census block-level population counts up to the precinct-level. The script to do the district labelling is <a href="https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/gerryspam/blob/master/MO/clean.py"> here</a>, 
    and the script to do the population aggregation is <a href="https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/gerryspam/blob/master/MO/prec_to_blocks.py">here</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Running the actual chain took about 9 hours, because I wanted to try each ensemble with various population deviations (1%, 3%, and 5%) and compare the outcomes. I 
    used <a href="https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/gerryspam/blob/master/MO/sampling.py">this script</a> to do the sampling, then randomly selected 2,000 data points from the final data to display on my visualization.
