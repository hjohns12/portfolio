        <h2>Process: Who's Still Talking About Guant치namo Bay?</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>
        After listening to a podcast, "The Other Latif" (which I highly recommend!), I realized that I don't read much news about Guant치namo Bay these days.
        I wanted to dig into how much or how little the mainstream media has reported on the subject over the past decade. I created a mix of static and interactive
        visualizations to illustrate the narrative of declining news coverage on the topic.

    <h3>Information Design</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>
        My primary goal for this project was to display the number of news stories written about Guant치namo Bay over time in a clear and simple way. I decided to create
        two separate to do so; a line chart displays the counts of daily news stories, and a bar chart aggregates the counts to yearly news stories. When I first made the line chart, I immediately wondered what happened in the news on the days with 
        big spikes in the number of stories. The annotations allowed me to share that with the viewer, which I hope helps them keep their focus on the rest of the 
        visualization.

        The technical architecture helped me keep track of what needed to be re-drawn once a change was made by the user (i.e., new selection
        from the drop-down or click on a new dot). I followed this document very closely when I started coding in order to keep track of all of the moving parts!

    <h3>Technical Overview</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>
    The data-generating process for this project was quite intensive. To create the final data I used <a href="https://gerrychain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">GerryChain</a>, a python library for using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods
     to study the problem of political redistricting. 

    The basic workflow is to start with the geometry of an initial plan (aka "initial partition") and generate a large collection of sample plans for comparison. 
    I constrained these sampled plans based on contiguity and population deviation between districts. Comparing the initial plan to the ensemble provides quantitative tools for measuring whether or not it is an outlier among the sampled plans.
    </p>

    <p>
    All of my data sources can be found in the README of <a href="https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/gerryspam/tree/master/MO">this repository</a>. 
    To clean the data, I used a precinct-level map from 2016 matched with elections. I labelled each precinct with state senate and state house legislative districts, 
    and aggregated the 2010 Census block-level population counts up to the precinct-level. The script to do the district labelling is <a href="https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/gerryspam/blob/master/MO/clean.py"> here</a>, 
    and the script to do the population aggregation is <a href="https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/gerryspam/blob/master/MO/prec_to_blocks.py">here</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Running the actual chain took about 9 hours, because I wanted to try each ensemble with various population deviations (1%, 3%, and 5%) and compare the outcomes. I 
    used <a href="https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/gerryspam/blob/master/MO/sampling.py">this script</a> to do the sampling, then randomly selected 2,000 data points from the final data to display on my visualization.
