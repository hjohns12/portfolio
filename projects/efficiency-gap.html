        <h2>Exploratory Project: A Million Maps of Missouri</h2>
        <br/>
    <p>
    This visualization was made for my work at the Princeton Gerrymandering Project. The efficiency gap is a metric that quantifies the 
    extremity of a partisan gerrymander. In early 2020, legislators in Missouri proposed a constitutional amendment 
    that would lower the efficiency gap floor to +/- 15%. My project aims to show what type of redistricting map such a floor would permit as legal.

    <h3>Design Process</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>
        The data generated by running a chain provided a lot of information, and my goal was to let the user explore how each 
        variable interacted with the others. Every row represented one possible redistricting plan, and I had information on the predicted vote share by district, 
        state-wide seat share, and the efficiency gap for each plan. I decided to create three main components that would all interact with each other: a box-and-whisker plot summarizing the 
        vote shares from the ensemble, a histogram displaying the spread of efficiency gaps, and a table to show the seat share for each data point. 
        Below is one of my first sketches showing how I initially envisioned the final product.

        The technical architecture helped me keep track of what needed to be re-drawn once a change was made by the user (i.e., new selection
        from the drop-down or click on a new dot). I followed this document very closely when I started coding in order to keep track of all of the moving parts!

        One of the most challenging parts of this project was creating the box-and-whisker plots. Figuring out how to go from the raw data to bins using JavaScript
        was surprisingly difficult. Luckily, Mike Bostock <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/box-plot"> shared an example</a> of his version and that helped me figure it out!
